            In Bangladesh people have been affected by monsoon floods from heavy and persistent rainfall which has
            forced thousands of people to abandon their homes.

            The downpours have caused extensive damage to thousands of houses, water sources, food stores, farmland and
            roads.

                Flood is a natural occurrence which turns to the overflow of water. It is highly dangerous sometimes; it
                wipes away the entire city and town. Most of the time, floods show an adverse impact on villages. When a
                flood occurs, it wipes out the object away like cars, furniture, and other items.

                    Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado,
                    flood, hurricane or blizzard. Texas families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from being
                    prepared in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few
                    days after the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.

                    in Bangladesh; this is
                    because of the difference in the nature of these two phenomena. Flood shelters in three locations
                    along three major rivers were visited, and communities were consulted to address some selected
                    issues regarding the shelters. Three major types of flood shelters were identified for the
                    comparison, which are community shelter, school-cum-shelter, and individual homestead.

                    In recent times, Bangladesh has experienced two devastating floods in 1988 and 1998, in addition to
                    occasional floods with moderate impact. However, little or no effort has been made to properly
                    document the impact of floods on primary education. The adoption of mitigation measures had been out
                    of consideration. Presently, primary education in Bangladesh is reeling from the devastating floods
                    of 2004 and undoubtedly, it is high time to assess alternative strategies to measure the impact of
                    floods and to assess mitigation options.
